🧠 Why This Set Feels More Varied
	•	Only a few touch “memory weight”
	•	Others invite:
	•	tempo
	•	atmosphere
	•	visuals
	•	textures
	•	small oddities
	•	contrasts
	•	movement
	•	mood shifts
	•	unexpected details
	•	playful quirks
	•	Nothing asks:
	•	“What was special?”
	•	“What was best?”
	•	“What moment mattered most?”

And they subtly point toward things you might want to capture in a scrapbook—without telling you to.
